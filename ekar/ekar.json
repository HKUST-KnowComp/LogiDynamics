      "both \"mayfly\" and \"big tree\" are from the idiom \"mayflies want to shake big trees\", which is a metaphor for not measuring one's own strength.",
      "the origin of \"egg\" and \"stone\" is the idiom of \"hitting a stone with an egg\", and \"stone\" is the target of \"egg\".",
      "the origin of \"lion\" and \"rabbit\" is the idiom \"not stint the strength of a lion in wrestling with a rabbit\", which means that the lion still uses all its strength to kill the rabbit, and metaphorically, the lion also puts all its strength to solving small matters seriously, and the \"lion\" kills the \"rabbit\".",
      "the idiom \"i am the fish while others are the knife and the chopping board\" includes the words \"fish\" and \"knife and chopping board\". this is a metaphor for the power of life and death in the hands of others, and one is in the position of being slaughtered. the two words \"knife and chopping board\" and \"fish meat\" are the tool and the object respectively.",
      "the origin of \"mantis\" and \"carriage\" is the idiom \"a praying mantis tries to stop a carriage\". the praying mantis raises its front legs to block the advance of the carriage. it is a metaphor for incorrectly estimating its own strength and doing things that cannot be done, which will inevitably lead to failure. \"mantis\" will block it."
